# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Frustrating Interface Ideas

- [ ] **Moving Buttons**: Buttons that move when clicked, jumping around the screen or switching positions unexpectedly.
- [ ] **Randomized Layout**: Unpredictable layout changes, with elements shifting around or changing size randomly.
- [ ] **Hidden Controls**: Important controls hidden in obscure places or behind layers of other elements.
- [ ] **Unpredictable Responses**: Interface responds unpredictably to user input, with actions varying or doing nothing at all.
- [ ] **Invasive Popups**: Flood the screen with popups or alerts that users must dismiss before continuing.
- [ ] **Color Distortion**: Introduce color distortion effects, making it hard to read text or distinguish between elements.
- [ ] **Unintuitive Controls**: Use non-standard controls or interactions that users wouldn't expect.
- [ ] **Time Pressure**: Add time limits to actions or tasks, forcing users to rush and increasing the likelihood of mistakes.
- [ ] **Aggressive Animations**: Use flashy or distracting animations that make it hard for users to focus.
- [ ] **Intermittent Connectivity**: Simulate connectivity issues, causing delays or errors when users try to interact.
