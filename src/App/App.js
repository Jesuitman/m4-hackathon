          <p>Well, let me tell ya somethin' 'bout Delaware. Them folks down there, they drive like they got all day! It's like they think they own the road or somethin'. Here in Jersey, we got places to be, and we ain't wastin' no time in the left lane doin' the speed limit. If you ain't doin' at least 80 in a 65, you're just holdin' up traffic! And don't even get me started on them roads. They're a mess, I tell ya. Potholes everywhere, and the traffic lights seem to be outta whack half the time. And don't even get me started on the rest of it. Them roads are like a twisted maze designed by a madman, and the weather's as unpredictable as a chicken in a fox den. It's either hotter than a pepper sprout or colder than a polar bear's toenail, ain't no middle ground! And talk about no fishin', it's like tryin' to catch a catfish in a dry creek bed. Wilmington ain't got no decent spots for fishin' neither, it's like they drained the whole darn river! Ain't no good fish to be fishin' for miles around! Ain't no Sam's Club neither, it's like tryin' to find a haystack without a needle. And blame it all on them knucklehead politicians, they couldn't organize a barn dance if their lives depended on it. And to top it all off, my ex-wife is in Delware. The first state might be small, but it's got more issues than a hound dog's got fleas.</p>
